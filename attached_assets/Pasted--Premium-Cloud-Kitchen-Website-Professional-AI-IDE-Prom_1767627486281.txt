## Design Philosophy: Premium Restaurant Digital Experience

### Visual Language
- **Aesthetic**: Michelin-guide level sophistication, not casual or playful
- **Mood**: Elegant, appetizing, trustworthy, premium yet accessible
- **References**: Think Zomato Pro, Swiggy Gourmet, high-end restaurant websites
- **3D Integration**: Subtle, purposeful, enhances food presentation (NOT gimmicky or game-like)
- **Photography Style**: Professional food photography - shallow depth, warm lighting, editorial quality

### Color Psychology for Food
```
Primary Palette:
- Deep Burgundy (#7D1935) - Rich, appetite-stimulating
- Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - Sophistication, premium feel

- Terracotta (#CC5500) - Warm, authentic, spice-inspired

Accent Colors:
- Gold (#D4AF37) - Premium highlights, special items
- Fresh Green (#2D5016) - Herbs, freshness, health
- Tomato Red (#C1121C) - Energy, appetite appeal

Typography:
- Headlines: Cormorant Garamond / Playfair Display (elegant serif)
- Subheadings: Montserrat SemiBold (modern, clean)
- Body: Source Sans Pro / Inter (readable, professional)
- Prices: Roboto Mono (clear, modern)
```

## 3D Implementation Guidelines - CRITICAL

### 3D Asset Quality Standards
**DO'S**:
✅ Use photorealistic food models (high polygon count, 10k-50k vertices)
✅ PBR materials (Physically Based Rendering): Metalness, roughness, normal maps
✅ Realistic textures: High-res diffuse maps (2048x2048 minimum)
✅ Professional lighting: Three-point lighting (key, fill, rim)
✅ Subtle animations: Gentle rotation (5-10 degrees/second)
✅ Optimize for web: Draco compression, LOD (Level of Detail)
✅ Fallback to high-quality 2D images on low-end devices

**DON'TS**:
❌ Cartoon-style or low-poly models
❌ Overly bright, unrealistic colors
❌ Fast spinning or bouncing animations
❌ Too many 3D elements competing for attention
❌ 3D for the sake of 3D (must serve presentation)
❌ Heavy files causing load delays

### 3D Integration Points

**1. Hero Section** (ONE primary 3D model):
```javascript
// Example: Signature dish with subtle animation
const dish3D = {
  model: 'hero_biryani.gltf',
  position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  rotation: { autoRotateSpeed: 0.5 },
  lighting: {
    ambient: warm,
    directional: { intensity: 1.5, position: [5, 10, 7.5] },
    spotlight: { color: 0xffffff, intensity: 0.8 }
  },
  camera: { fov: 35, position: [0, 1, 5] },
  controls: { enableZoom: false, enablePan: false }
}
```

**2. Menu Item Modals** (On-demand loading):
```javascript
// Only load 3D when user clicks "View in 3D"
onClick: loadModel('item_burger.gltf')
- Smooth transition from 2D to 3D view
- Loading indicator: Elegant spinner
- OrbitControls: Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom
- Reset view button
```

**3. Combo Plates** (Composite 3D scenes):
```javascript
// Multiple items arranged on a plate
comboScene = {
  plate: 'base_plate.gltf',
  items: [
    { model: 'biryani_bowl.gltf', position: [-2, 0, 0] },
    { model: 'naan.gltf', position: [2, 0, 0] },
    { model: 'raita_bowl.gltf', position: [0, 0, 2] }
  ],
  presentation: 'restaurant_table_setting'
}
```

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load 3D assets (load only when in viewport)
- Use WebGL renderer with antialias
- Implement texture compression
- Provide 2D fallback for unsupported browsers
- Max file size per model: 2-5MB
- FPS target: 60fps on mid-range devices

---

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack Requirements
```javascript
// Core Technologies
HTML5 (Semantic markup)
CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
JavaScript (ES6+, Modules)

// 3D & Animation
Three.js (r140+) - 3D rendering
GSAP 3 - Smooth animations
GLTFLoader - 3D model loading
OrbitControls - 3D interaction

// Performance
Intersection Observer - Lazy loading
Web Workers - Heavy computations
Service Workers - Offline capability (optional)

// Utilities
Axios/Fetch - API calls (for future orders)
Swiper.js - Carousels
AOS (Animate On Scroll) - Scroll animations
```

## Responsive Design Breakpoints

```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Default: Mobile (320px - 767px) */

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet */
  - 2-column menu grid
  - Larger text
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Desktop */
  - 3-4 column menu grid
  - Side-by-side layouts
  - Full 3D capabilities
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  /* Large Desktop */
  - Maximum width: 1400px
  - Enhanced 3D effects
}
```

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)
- Simplified 3D (or 2D fallback)
- Collapsible menu categories
- Sticky "Order Now" button at bottom
- Optimized images (WebP format)
- Lazy loading all images
- Reduced animations

---

## Animation & Interaction Guidelines

### Scroll Animations
```javascript
// Trigger animations on scroll-into-view
Elements to animate:
- Menu cards: Fade up + stagger (100ms delay between each)
- Stats counters: Count-up animation
- Section headings: Fade in with underline draw
- Images: Subtle zoom-in effect
```

### Hover States
```css
Menu Cards:
- Transform: translateY(-8px)
- Box-shadow: 0 12px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)
- Image: scale(1.05)
- Transition: all 0.3s ease-out

Buttons:
- Background color shift
- Slight scale (1.02)
- Subtle glow effect
- Smooth transition (0.2s)
```

### Loading States
- Skeleton screens for menu items
- Elegant spinner for 3D model loading
- Progress indicator for image loading
- Smooth fade-in when content ready

## Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

```html
<!-- Semantic HTML -->
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
<main aria-label="Menu and ordering">
<section aria-labelledby="menu-heading">

<!-- Alt text for all images -->
<img src="biryani.jpg" alt="Aromatic chicken biryani with basmati rice and garnished with fried onions">

<!-- Keyboard navigation -->
- Tab through all interactive elements
- Enter to activate buttons
- Arrow keys for carousels
- Escape to close modals

<!-- Color contrast -->
- Text: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Buttons: 3:1 minimum

<!-- Focus indicators -->
- Visible focus outline on all interactive elements
- Skip to content link

<!-- Screen reader support -->
- ARIA labels on all buttons
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- Descriptive link text (no "click here")
```

---

## Content Writing Guidelines

### Tone of Voice
- **Professional yet warm**: Not corporate, not overly casual
- **Confident**: "Fresh ingredients daily" not "We try to use fresh ingredients"
- **Descriptive**: Use sensory words (aromatic, tender, crispy, rich)
- **Authentic**: Honest about YouTube origins, don't oversell
- **Action-oriented**: Clear CTAs throughout

### Menu Description Formula
```
[Item Name]
[One-line sensory description highlighting key ingredients/preparation]

Example:
"Chicken Tikka Masala
Tender charcoal-grilled chicken in a velvety tomato cream sauce, aromatic with fenugreek and garam masala"

NOT:
"Chicken Tikka Masala
A popular Indian dish with chicken and sauce"
```

### Avoid These Phrases
❌ "Best in Delhi" (unprovable)
❌ "Secret recipe" (overused)
❌ "Grandma's recipe" (unless actually true)
❌ "Authentic" without context
❌ Over-the-top claims

---

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Strategy

### Primary CTAs (Most Prominent)
1. "Order Now via WhatsApp" - Green button
2. "View Full Menu" - Main button
3. "Order on Zomato/Swiggy" - App buttons

### Secondary CTAs
- "Watch Our Story"
- "Download Menu PDF"
- "Subscribe for Offers"
- "View in 3D"

### CTA Design Standards
```css
Primary Button:
- Background: #25D366 (WhatsApp green) or brand color
- Text: White, bold
- Padding: 14px 32px
- Border-radius: 8px
- Box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
- Hover: Lift + darken
- Icon: WhatsApp or phone icon

Secondary Button:
- Background: Transparent
- Border: 2px solid brand color
- Text: Brand color
- Hover: Fill with brand color
```
